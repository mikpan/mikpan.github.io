10 years since CS degree and today I am officially back to the school bench again! Okay-okay, have not counted 6 years as a Ph.D. student. So that makes 4 years outside of the academic field. Not really: minus 1 year as a post-doc. So finally 3 years of life in the private business domain was like a short break. And here I am back again.

My first day at ETH as a further education student (CAS). Visited two courses:
1. [Data Mining: Learning from Large data sets][DM-2017] <br/>
A practical course where one seems to start immediately with the modern ML toolkit methods and then slowly learn why and where the methods can be used.
1. [Machine Learning][ML-2017] <br/>
A theory to practice course where one starts with the theoretical and even philosophical foundations of ML and then slowly apply the theory with the practical exercises.

Looking forward to learning more about Machine Learning!
